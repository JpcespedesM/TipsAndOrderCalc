# TIPS AND ORDER CALCULATOR

## Description
This project is created in Vite + React + Typescript. It allows you to select a variety of products from a restaurant menu, add them to the order, delete them from it or increase its quantity. It also allows you to select the tip % you want to give, and it calculates the total to pay.

## What I learned
* Create my own hooks, so that my code would be more reusable.
* Use of Tailwind to give style to every component of the web site.
* Use of useMemo and useCallBack, why and when should I use them and the differences between them.
* Improved performance rendering some components.
